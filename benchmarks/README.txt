# host id ordering
#

Testbed node ids are sequential from host193 to host288.
Note, due to physical layout of the testbed racks, nodes are connected to
leaf switches in even/odd blocks of 12 host ids.

For example, one leaf switch has the following block of node ids:
193
195
197
199
201
203
205
207
209
211
213
215

Another has the following block:
194
196
198
200
202
204
206
208
210
212
214
216
