# host id ordering
#

Testbed host ids run sequentially from host193 to host288.  Due to physical 
layout of the testbed racks, even and odd blocks of 12 host ids are connected
to each leaf switch.

For example, one switch has the following block of 12 odd ids:
host193
host195
host197
host199
host201
host203
host205
host207
host209
host211
host213
host215

Another switch has the following block of 12 even ids:
host194
host196
host198
host200
host202
host204
host206
host208
host210
host212
host214
host216
